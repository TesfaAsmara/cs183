## Installation

I installed PySpark by following the instructions in the [Apache Spark
documentation](https://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/api/python/getting_started/install.html).

I created a new conda environment. I installed pip, PySpark, and
PyArrow.

``` {sh}
conda create -n sparkenv -y
conda activate sparkenv
conda install pip -y
/.../sparkenv/bin/pip install pyspark
conda install -c conda-forge pyarrow -y 
```
